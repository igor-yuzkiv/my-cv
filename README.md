# My CV Project

This is a learning project where I aimed to explore the capabilities of pure JavaScript and Web Components. The project represents a simple and creative implementation of a CV that simulates a retro-style file browser.

## Project Goals
- **Learn and apply Web Components**: A modern way to build reusable and encapsulated UI elements.
- **Work with Vanilla JavaScript**: Avoiding any frameworks or libraries to gain deeper understanding of core JavaScript concepts.
- **Practice building a SPA (Single Page Application)**: Implementing basic routing and dynamic navigation using JavaScript.
- **Experiment with design**: Combining functionality with a unique retro-inspired look.
